1. Add compression support ( quite simple task )

2. Not sure if it's possible.
   On the server side: 
      Try to get rid of QVariants and get information about supported
      methods and parameters types using QMetaObject / QMetaMethod 
      to get information about signals/slots. I'd like to have something 
      like python version from test/pyserver, but with extra types checks.


   For the client side:
      maybe it worth to generate wrapper class around
      xmlrpc::Client, based on the description of server calls 
      ( WSDL or something similar ). 
      The advantage of this is more errors protected client implementation, 
      but extra code generation can make build process more complex.

      Still have to consider if it worths, in any case looks like there is
      a space for improvements here 
      ( however this doesn't mean the current implementation is incomplete ).
